## 🔒 Security Considerations for Educational Use

VirtualLab is designed for educational environments with the following security principles:

### 🎓 Educational Safety
- **Hardware Protection**: Built-in emergency stops and current limiting
- **Safe Defaults**: Conservative PWM limits to prevent motor damage  
- **User Isolation**: Each session operates independently
- **Data Privacy**: No student data collection or storage

### 🌐 Web Security
- **Local Operation**: Designed to run locally, minimizing network exposure
- **Serial API**: Uses browser's Web Serial API with user consent
- **No External Dependencies**: Minimal external resource loading
- **Client-Side Only**: No server-side data processing or storage

### 🔧 Hardware Security
- **Electrical Safety**: Proper isolation between high and low voltage circuits
- **Physical Safety**: Emergency stop mechanisms in all control interfaces
- **Component Protection**: Overcurrent and thermal protection recommended
- **User Training**: Comprehensive safety documentation provided
